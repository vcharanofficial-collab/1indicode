# Indicode Compiler Front-End Status Report

**Status date:** 2026-11-03  
**Scope:** Indicode front end only; LLVM/backend/runtime work is excluded.

The companion [catalogue audit PDF](../Compiler_Front_End_Remaining_Work.pdf)
contains the full 40-item checklist and remaining-work detail; it is generated
from [FRONT_END_REMAINING_WORK.md](./FRONT_END_REMAINING_WORK.md).

## Executive summary

The front end reads Indicode source, tokenizes and parses the supported
language, checks names and types, reports source-aware diagnostics, and lowers
valid input to a typed HIR that is independently verified.

| Measure | Current status |
|---|---:|
| Weighted front-end completion estimate | **97.10% (rounded to 97%)** |
| Front-end catalogue items done to current v1 scope | **30 / 40** |
| Partially implemented catalogue items | **0 / 40** |
| Not started catalogue items | **10 / 40** |
| Current CTest suite | **19 / 19 passed** |

The 97.10% figure is a judgment-based, weighted estimate of the front-end
acceptance areas below. It is not the percentage of the 40-item catalogue:
30/40 items equals 75% by count, while the weighted estimate gives much more
credit to mature build, lexer, parser, and semantic areas. Neither figure
means that the entire language, LLVM compiler, runtime, or original 777-item
project catalogue is complete.

## Scope and limitations

The agreed working boundary is a documented, single-file Indicode v1 front
end that can produce verified typed HIR. Grammar and semantics v1 are
specified in [LANGUAGE_SPEC_V1.md](./LANGUAGE_SPEC_V1.md) and
[SEMANTICS_V1.md](./SEMANTICS_V1.md).

Modules/imports, overloads, generic declarations and their constraint/
substitution engines, ownership/borrowing, effect checking, symbol indexing,
and incremental parsing are not implemented. Several are explicitly outside
the current v1 syntax/semantic contract; they remain visible in the catalogue
as future work rather than being claimed as completed. There is no LLVM
adapter, machine-code generation, executable runtime, tensor execution, or
device backend. The project is not production-ready: full conformance,
coverage-guided fuzzing, sanitizer gates, release CI, and compatibility/ABI
policy remain.

## Weighted progress by acceptance area

| Area | Weight | Done | Points | Evidence and remaining gap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Project/build foundation | 5% | 95% | 4.75 | C++20/CMake library, CLI, CTest, install/export package and separate package consumer; release CI remains. |
| Source manager and diagnostics | 10% | 97% | 9.70 | Owned source buffers, indexed line tables, byte/scalar columns, tab-aware diagnostics, notes, fix-its and JSON schema v1; terminal display-width and editor integration remain. |
| Lexer | 15% | 92% | 13.80 | Typed token payloads, trivia, UTF-8 validation, strings, radix integers, separators and nested comments; Unicode identifiers, suffix policy and complete numeric grammar remain. |
| Parser and AST | 15% | 99% | 14.85 | Grammar v1, precedence, recovery, golden printer, exhaustive visitor and ownership/lifetime contract; broader conformance remains. |
| Name resolution | 10% | 95% | 9.50 | v1 scopes/namespaces, shadowing, stable identities and HIR binding checks; modules/imports/overloads remain future work. |
| Type checking and semantic validation | 15% | 99% | 14.85 | v1 declarations, expressions, calls, conversions, records, collections, tensor shapes, constants and conservative flow/return checking; ownership/effects and tensor operations remain outside v1. |
| Typed HIR and verification | 15% | 99% | 14.85 | AST lowering, stable symbols, schema-v1 JSON and independent checks of types, scopes, identities, calls, mutability and return paths; deserialization and broader compatibility guarantees remain. |
| CLI and diagnostics tooling | 5% | 98% | 4.90 | `check`, `tokens`, `ast`, `ast-json`, `typed`, `typed-json`, source excerpts and schema-v1 diagnostics; editor API and terminal display-width support remain. |
| Tests, docs and integration | 10% | 99% | 9.90 | 19 passing tests including malformed-input smoke tests and installed-package consumer; full conformance, fuzzing, sanitizers and CI remain. |
| **Total** | **100%** |  | **97.10%** | **Rounded display: 97%.** |

Calculation: `4.75 + 9.70 + 13.80 + 14.85 + 9.50 + 14.85 + 14.85 + 4.90 + 9.90 = 97.10`.

## What is implemented

### Source model and lexer

- Owned source files, stable source IDs, spans, indexed CR/LF/CRLF line lookup,
  byte offsets, UTF-8 scalar columns, and four-column tab stops.
- Stable lexer diagnostics and recovery for malformed tokens, UTF-8, numeric
  forms, strings, and comments.
- Typed keyword/integer/float/string payloads; original spelling and source
  spans are retained.
- Source-spanned whitespace and line/block-comment trivia; nested block
  comments preserve newline separators.
- ASCII identifiers, supported string escapes and Unicode scalar escapes,
  decimal floats, binary/octal/hex integers, and digit separators.

### Grammar, parser and AST

- Normative grammar version 1.0.0, recursive-descent declarations/statements,
  and Pratt expression parsing with documented precedence/associativity.
- Functions, records, typed fields, lists, calls with named arguments,
  indexing, member access, loops, integer ranges, conditionals and nested
  `else if`.
- Declaration, statement and delimited-expression recovery; valid later
  statements and sibling expressions are retained after malformed input.
- Deterministic AST printer golden output; public `AstVisitor` callbacks for
  every declaration, statement kind and expression kind; full-tree `walk_ast`.
- Documented AST ownership/lifetime contract. `Program` owns syntax nodes;
  nodes do not borrow token/source text. Source contents must still be retained
  separately when source excerpts are needed.
- Schema-versioned AST JSON and source spans.

### Name binding, types and semantic checks

- Separate v1 value/function/type lookup rules, lexical block scopes, permitted
  outer-value shadowing, duplicate declaration diagnostics, and stable
  identities for values, functions, record types/fields, builtins and
  references.
- Type inference/checking for supported declarations, literals, expressions,
  operators, function calls, named arguments, records, lists, text, indexing,
  integer ranges, and checked numeric conversions.
- Static tensor type validation for numeric elements and exact rank,
  dimensions, and element types. Symbolic dimensions match by name; tensor
  operations/broadcasting/device placement are not supported.
- Bounded integer/Boolean constant evaluation with short-circuiting,
  signed-64-bit overflow and division-by-zero checks, and a deterministic
  256-node evaluation budget.
- Condition/count/return checks, unreachable-statement diagnostics, and
  conservative definite-return analysis. A loop is not assumed to execute.
- Semantic rules are tested and independently rechecked in typed HIR where
  applicable.

### Diagnostics, HIR, CLI and packaging

- Text diagnostics with source excerpts/carets, stable severity/code
  identifiers, notes/secondary spans, fix-its and multi-error reporting.
- Diagnostic JSON schema v1 with version envelope, locations, notes, fix-it
  data, escaping, deterministic ordering and golden-output tests.
- Project-owned typed HIR lowering and independent verification of types,
  symbols, visibility, mutability, calls, loops, returns and control flow.
- CLI commands: `check`, `tokens`, `ast`, `ast-json`, `typed`, and `typed-json`;
  JSON output is schema-versioned.
- CMake install/export package and a separately built package-consumer test.

## Catalogue audit: all 40 front-end items

The original front-end catalogue covers IDs 445–484. “Done” means accepted
for the documented, implemented v1 scope; it does not imply future features
listed under “Not started”.

| Status | IDs | Concepts |
|---|---|---|
| Done (30) | 445–459 | Source manager, source buffer, source span, line table, column mapping, UTF-8 validator, token kind, token payload, lexer state, trivia preservation, parser state, recursive-descent parser, Pratt parser, grammar version, AST context. |
| Done (30) | 461–467 | AST visitor, AST printer, AST serializer, syntax recovery, error synchronization, symbol identity, scope table. |
| Done (30) | 471–472 | Name binding, type checker. |
| Done (30) | 475–477 | Constant evaluator, control-flow validation, definite-return analysis. |
| Done (30) | 480–482 | Tensor shape checker, diagnostic engine, JSON diagnostics. |
| Not started (10) | 460 | AST node arena / ownership alternative measurement. The current AST uses ordinary C++ value/`unique_ptr` ownership. |
| Not started (10) | 468–470 | Module resolver, import resolver, and overload candidate selection. |
| Not started (10) | 473–474 | Generic constraint solver and type substitution engine. |
| Not started (10) | 478–479 | Effect checker and ownership/borrowing checker. |
| Not started (10) | 483–484 | Language-server symbol/reference index and incremental parsing. |

There are no catalogue items currently marked “Partial”. The ten not-started
items are not hidden by the 97% weighted estimate.

## Remaining work to reach the next milestones

1. **AST scalability:** measure large-input allocation/destruction and decide
   whether an arena is beneficial or whether documented `unique_ptr` ownership
   remains the chosen design (ID 460).
2. **Modules and imports:** define module identity, search roots, import aliases,
   visibility, missing-import/ambiguity diagnostics and cycle behavior (IDs
   468–469). This requires a language-scope decision beyond single-file v1.
3. **Overloads and generics:** decide whether overloads/generics enter a future
   grammar version, then implement overload selection, constraint solving and
   type substitution with ambiguity and failure tests (IDs 470, 473–474).
4. **Effects and ownership:** specify effect and ownership/borrowing models
   before implementing their checkers; these cannot be safely inferred from the
   current v1 rules (IDs 478–479).
5. **Editor and incremental support:** build a source-aware definitions/
   references index, define edit invalidation, and verify incremental parses
   match clean parses (IDs 483–484).
6. **Production/release readiness:** add requirement-linked full v1
   conformance, coverage-guided fuzzing, sanitizers, clean offline CI/release
   builds, and a documented compatibility policy. These are acceptance gaps
   reflected in the weighted areas even when not separate catalogue IDs.
