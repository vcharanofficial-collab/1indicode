# Indicode Front-End Progress

Updated: 2026-11-03

## Scope

This phase builds only the Indicode front end, targeting a validated typed representation that a future LLVM backend can consume. It now includes an initial tensor type and static/symbolic shape-compatibility subset; tensor operations, broadcasting, dynamic shape guards, and device checks are not implemented. LLVM is not downloaded, vendored, or built in this repository. LLVM IR generation, machine-code generation, tensor execution, autodiff runtime/training, and device backends are outside the current phase.

## Production Readiness

This repository is a real, buildable, tested compiler-front-end prototype, but it is **not production-ready** and should not be represented as a deployable general-purpose compiler. The supported grammar and semantics are a small documented subset. There is no LLVM adapter or executable generation, language conformance suite, production CI/release process, fuzzing campaign, sanitizer gate, or compatibility/ABI policy. Use it for development and evaluation of the implemented subset, not as a production compiler.

## Completion

**Overall front-end completion: 97%**

The percentage measures progress toward the agreed front-end-only boundary in the [detailed status report](./FRONT_END_STATUS_REPORT.md) and [PDF](../Compiler_Front_End_Status_Report.pdf), not progress toward LLVM itself or the full compiler. It is a weighted estimate: each area's weight is fixed, and completion credit requires implemented, tested, documented acceptance behavior. The 13 previously partial catalogue items and two small AST-infrastructure items now meet the documented single-file v1 acceptance level. The weighted estimate is **97.10%, rounded to 97%**; modules/imports, overloads, production readiness, and full conformance remain unfinished.

| Acceptance area | Weight | Area completion | Evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project/build foundation | 5% | 95% | C++20, CMake, CTest, install/export package config, public headers and a separately configured/compiled package consumer; CI/release acceptance remains. |
| Source manager and diagnostics | 10% | 97% | Source manager owns immutable-by-interface buffers, stable file IDs, indexed CR/LF/CRLF line tables, byte-to-line/scalar-column mapping, source spans, tab-aware carets, secondary notes, JSON escaping, and validated fix-it edits; terminal display-width handling remains. |
| Lexer | 15% | 92% | ASCII identifiers, typed keyword and literal payloads, exact-source trivia, UTF-8 source validation, strings/escapes, binary/octal/hex integers, digit separators, nested block comments with newline preservation, and scalar/tab-aware source columns; Unicode identifiers, suffix policy, and complete numeric grammar remain. |
| Parser and AST | 15% | 99% | Grammar v1.0.0 specifies the accepted syntax; deterministic AST golden output, an exhaustive typed visitor, explicit ownership/lifetime rules, and declaration/statement/expression recovery are tested; broader grammar and conformance testing remain. |
| Name resolution | 10% | 95% | Separate v1 namespaces, nested scopes/shadowing, stable identities for supported declarations/references, and independent HIR binding checks; modules/imports/overloads are excluded by v1 and remain future work. |
| Type checking and semantic validation | 15% | 99% | Documented v1 rules cover declarations, expressions/operators/calls/conversions, records, collections, tensor shapes, constant evaluation, and conservative control-flow/return validation; ownership/effects and tensor operations remain outside v1. |
| Typed HIR and verification | 15% | 99% | Project-owned typed HIR carries stable local/function/type/field identities and schema-versioned JSON; verifier rechecks lexical visibility, identity uniqueness/references, immutability, return paths, and expression/call/loop contracts. Deserialization and compatibility policy remain. |
| CLI and diagnostics tooling | 5% | 98% | `check`, `tokens`, `ast`, `ast-json`, `typed`, `typed-json`, source excerpts/carets aligned across tabs and UTF-8 scalar columns, and schema-v1 JSON diagnostics with notes/fix-its; terminal-specific display widths and editor interfaces remain. |
| Tests, docs, and integration | 10% | 99% | Nineteen CTest cases cover source mapping, lexer/trivia, grammar/operators, AST golden output and exhaustive visitor coverage, AST lifetime, expression/declaration recovery, semantic constant/flow/tensor checks, HIR identities, full diagnostic JSON golden output, CLI, malformed-input smoke testing, and an installed-package consumer; full conformance, coverage-guided fuzzing, sanitizers, and CI remain. |

Updated weighted estimate: 4.75 + 9.7 + 13.8 + 14.85 + 9.5 + 14.85 + 14.85 + 4.9 + 9.9 = **97.10%, rounded to 97%**. This is a judgment-based estimate for the implemented v1 front-end boundary, not a claim that 97% of a complete language specification or all possible compiler work is done.

## Work completed

- Added a C++20 CMake library and a CTest-based lexer test executable.
- Added source locations/spans, source-file storage, diagnostic records, and token definitions.
- Added an owning source manager with source IDs, indexed line lookup, CR/LF/CRLF handling, UTF-8 scalar/tab-aware byte-offset mapping, and CLI/diagnostic integration.
- Implemented initial lexing for identifiers, selected keywords, numeric and string literals, punctuation, operators, `#` line comments, and newline separators.
- Added stable lexer error codes for unsupported characters, malformed logical operators, malformed exponents, and unterminated strings.
- Added tests covering function syntax, CRLF line endings, comments, strings, EOF, and recoverable malformed literals.
- Configured and built with GCC 13.3 and CMake; the lexer CTest target passes (1/1).
- Added an AST model and parser for function signatures, variable declarations, assignment, return, if/else, while, repeat, calls, and precedence-based expressions.
- Added parser tests for function/body structure, expression precedence, recoverable syntax errors, and empty input; lexer and parser CTest targets pass (2/2).
- Added scope-based name lookup, function signature checks, inferred types on expressions, basic mutability/type checks, and return-path validation for simple branches.
- Added the `indicode` CLI with `check`, `tokens`, `ast`, and `typed` commands, plus valid/invalid CLI integration fixtures.
- Added a source-oriented AST/typed-tree printer and documented local build and command usage.
- Added schema-versioned JSON serialization for the parsed AST, retaining declarations, expression/statement kinds, source spans, named argument labels, and nested statements; exposed it as `indicode ast-json` and added structure/span/escaping tests.
- Added context-typed integer literals with range checks for Byte/U8, Int2/UInt2, Int/UInt, and Long/ULong; signed minimum values are checked without overflow.
- Added `examples/hello.indi` as the first runnable end-to-end front-end sample.
- Added project-owned typed HIR types and AST-to-HIR lowering without LLVM headers, libraries, downloads, or build integration.
- Added an HIR verifier for type annotations, expression structure, operator consistency, call signatures, statement types, and return types; `indicode typed` now prints verified HIR.
- Added HIR tests for valid lowering/verification, typed output, and rejection of an invalid type annotation.
- Added source-line/caret text diagnostics and opt-in `--json-diagnostics` with stable codes, escaped messages, file paths, and structured source spans.
- Added homogeneous list literals, list/text indexing, and `for item in items` for-each loops through AST, semantic checking, HIR, verifier, printer, and CLI.
- Added UTF-8 validation for string contents, common string escape checks, `\u{...}` Unicode scalar validation, and Char/Text inference by scalar count.
- Added lexer, semantic, HIR, diagnostic, and JSON CLI regression tests for the new behavior.
- Documented supported list/iteration/index and Unicode-string rules, including positive/negative examples and current limits.
- Added strict community contribution rules and a beginner-readable roadmap explaining the LLVM boundary and percentage calculation.
- Added binary/octal/hexadecimal integer literals and underscore separators with malformed-digit/separator diagnostics and destination range checks.
- Added named function arguments end-to-end, including parameter-name resolution, duplicate/unknown/missing argument errors, and HIR preservation.
- Added nested block comments, preserved their newline separators, and diagnosed unterminated comments.
- Added record declarations, named record construction, and typed member access through parsing, semantic analysis, HIR lowering/verification, printers, and CLI coverage.
- Added checked integer conversion calls to all supported integer destination types; conversion requires a numeric input and `checked: true`, and integer constants are range-checked before lowering.
- Added checked numeric conversion calls to `Half`, `Float`, and `Double`, with compile-time finite/range checks for numeric literals.
- Added `Tensor<Element, [Dimension, ...]>` types with numeric element validation and static/symbolic dimension compatibility through signatures, semantic checking, HIR, and CLI example coverage.
- Improved declaration-level parser recovery so malformed function/record declarations do not consume later valid declarations; added a deterministic 1,000-input lexer/parser robustness smoke test.
- Added `start..end` integer range expressions with same-integer-type bounds, `Range<T>` HIR verification, and integer range iteration binding for `for` loops.
- Added nested `else if` parsing as nested conditional AST/HIR nodes, with return-path analysis across each branch.
- Added independent HIR verification that non-`Void` functions return on every supported conditional path.
- Strengthened independent HIR checks to reject duplicate parameter names, argument-label metadata that is not aligned with call operands, and returns outside functions.
- Aligned diagnostic carets with expanded tabs and UTF-8 scalar columns; terminal-specific wide/combining-character display widths remain out of scope.
- Added optional diagnostic fix-its with replacement spans, messages, text hints, and JSON output; the parser suggests inserting `: ` after a function parameter name when its colon is missing.
- Added semantic errors for decimal floating-point literals that overflow or underflow the supported host conversion range.
- Lexer source columns now count valid UTF-8 continuation bytes as part of one scalar and expand tabs to four-column stops; byte offsets remain unchanged for slicing and edits.
- The lexer rejects malformed UTF-8 in line and block comments as well as strings and other source tokens.
- Added stable IDs for local variables, parameters, and loop bindings through semantic analysis and AST-to-HIR lowering; HIR printing exposes those IDs for backend inspection.
- HIR verification now independently checks lexical name visibility, matching symbol identity and type, immutable assignments, duplicate declarations, loop scope boundaries, and global bindings visible from functions.
- Added CMake install/export rules, a versioned package config, and a CTest consumer that installs the library, configures a separate CMake project, links `indicode::frontend`, and runs it.
- Added canonical `typed-json` CLI output with schema version 1, typed nodes, source spans, argument labels, and stable local symbol IDs; a CMake JSON check validates the schema and a parameter reference.
- Completed the v1 AST-printer golden snapshot for every declaration, statement, expression kind, and grammar operator.
- Added expression-delimiter recovery for call arguments/list elements, retained valid sibling expressions, documented synchronization sets, and tested applied parser fix-its.
- Added stable per-analysis IDs for functions, record types/fields, builtins, type references, and calls; HIR verification rejects duplicate or mismatched identities.
- Specified v1 namespaces and semantic typing rules, including conservative branch/loop return analysis, exact tensor shape compatibility, and which module/import/overload features are excluded.
- Added a bounded integer/Boolean constant evaluator with short-circuiting, signed overflow/division-by-zero diagnostics, a 256-node budget, conversion-range integration, and boundary tests.
- Published diagnostic text/JSON policies with secondary notes and schema v1; full-output golden tests cover spans, fix-its, notes, escaping, and multiple diagnostics.
- Added semantic errors for unreachable statements, invalid `Void` values, duplicate declarations with previous-location notes, and invalid `say(Void)` calls; HIR independently rejects the latter.

## Current limitations

- Grammar v1.0.0 is specified in `LANGUAGE_SPEC_V1.md`; modules/imports, generic function/record declarations, overloads, and declaration visibility are explicitly outside this syntax version.
- Identifiers are ASCII-only. UTF-8 source sequences are validated, but Unicode identifier rules and full Unicode display-column mapping are not implemented.
- Numeric suffixes, raw strings, and the complete string escape repertoire remain incomplete.
- Semantic checking follows the documented single-file v1 rules; conversions require explicit checked mode and tensor compatibility is exact shape/type equality. Ownership/effects, tensor operations/broadcasting/device checks, and numeric widening are outside v1.
- Modules/imports, overloads, and generic declarations are not in grammar v1; module/import resolvers and overload selection remain unstarted. Range runtime behavior is undefined because this front end does not execute programs.
- Typed HIR/verifier cover the supported v1 subset and verify stable identities; deserialization, broader compatibility guarantees, and full language conformance remain before an LLVM adapter is ready.

## Milestones

1. **Source model and lexer:** complete UTF-8/source management, token coverage, literal validation, and lexer tests.
2. **Parser and AST:** documented v1 grammar, precedence, source spans, deterministic printer output, and declaration/statement/expression recovery are implemented and tested.
3. **Names and types:** v1 scopes, identities, name resolution, typing, conversion/range checks, and diagnostics are implemented and tested.
4. **Core semantic validation:** v1 function/control-flow checks, mutability, constant evaluation, and negative tests are implemented.
5. **Typed HIR:** lowering, printer, verifier, schema-versioned JSON, symbol identity checks, and focused tests cover the supported v1 subset; deserialization and broader compatibility guarantees remain.
6. **Front-end CLI and release checks:** `check`, `tokens`, `ast`, `ast-json`, `typed`, `typed-json`, and schema-v1 JSON diagnostics exist; full conformance, fuzzing, sanitizers, and release/CI checks remain.

LLVM/backend work begins only after these front-end milestones are complete and accepted. The front end is being designed to connect to LLVM later without requiring the LLVM framework to be downloaded into this repository now.

## Latest verification

- The Release-mode out-of-tree build in `/tmp/indicode-partial-build` succeeds with GCC 13.3.
- All 19 CTest cases pass, including lexer payload/trivia contracts, versioned grammar and operator coverage, AST visitor/lifetime checks, parser recovery/fix-its, semantic constant/flow/tensor checks, HIR identity verification, diagnostic JSON golden output, CLI checks, and the installed-package consumer.
- The suite also verifies nested `else if` return coverage, malformed HIR return-path rejection, invalid HIR parameter/call/return/symbol-scope invariants, UTF-8/tab diagnostic caret alignment, and float literal overflow/underflow rejection.
- Lexer regression tests confirm that UTF-8 byte offsets and human-facing source columns remain distinct and consistent after tabs and non-ASCII string contents.
- The verification build was kept outside the project; no generated build files were added to the repository.
